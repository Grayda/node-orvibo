# About this example #
This example shows the how to add, query and delete timers on your Orvibo device. This example (and the associated code) is still a work in progress.

# Running this example
Run `node index.js`. After a compatible device has been queried, a new timer will be added with the current time. The test will then query the device for any timers present. When this is done, check the WiWo app for the newly created timer. After 2 minutes, the timer will be deleted.
